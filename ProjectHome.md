The goal of this project is to build an app that compels individuals to delve into unexplored urban sites and to collaboratively map out unique features of urban space for other individuals to explore. The back-end of this app would provide literal ‘maps’ of user behaviour which would be situated against user demographics including age, gender and social-economic status. This data is of two-fold interest to applied urban anthropologists, who are interested in solving real-world problems involving urban space.
